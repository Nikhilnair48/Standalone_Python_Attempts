Category Tree

A binary tree like data structure, with the a couple notable differences/additions:

1. [DIFF] Adding a category to a Category Tree would require the parent to be passed as a parameter.
2. [ADD] A function to print the children of a given node that prints all nodes exluding the current, root node.

Condition #1 mean that Category Tree would be closer to an N-ary tree in that each parent may have n children. Maximum currently set to two.

To run:

1. git clone git@github.com:Nikhilnair48/Standalone_Python_Attempts.git

2. cd Standalone_Python_Attempts/Category_Tree

3. python Category_Tree.py
